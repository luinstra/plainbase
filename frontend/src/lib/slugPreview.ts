/**
 * ADVISORY slug/path preview for the `/new` form — NEVER used for navigation (the server-returned
 * `result.created.url` is the sole navigation truth). Pure — no React, no DOM (mirrors lib/unifiedDiff.ts).
 *
 * The REAL slug authority is the server's `HeadingSlugger.slugify`
 * (`server …/domain/render/HeadingSlugger.kt:44-55`). A browser cannot replicate it bit-for-bit; this is a
 * deliberate APPROXIMATION whose only job is to help the author guess the filename. Known divergences:
 *  - **Whitespace set:** the server folds a data-pinned 25-element `White_Space=Yes` set (one `-` per code
 *    point, no run-collapsing); JS `\p{White_Space}` tracks the engine's Unicode version, which can drift
 *    from the JDK tables the server's set was frozen against (e.g. U+001C–U+001F: excluded by the server,
 *    matched by some JDK predicates the spec rejects) — so it can disagree at the Unicode fringe.
 *  - **Keep-set:** the server keeps JDK `Character.getType` Letter (Lu/Ll/Lt/Lm/Lo) + Mark (Mn/Mc/Me) +
 *    Decimal Number (Nd) + `-`/`_`. JS `\p{L}\p{M}\p{Nd}` approximates but is not provably equal across
 *    Unicode versions.
 *  - **NFC + lowercase:** order matches (lowercase BEFORE NFC, final NFC), but the JS lowercase/NFC tables
 *    can drift by a Unicode version vs. the JDK. On realistic ASCII/Latin doc titles they agree.
