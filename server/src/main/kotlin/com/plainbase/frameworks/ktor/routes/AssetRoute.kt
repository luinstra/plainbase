/**
 * `GET /assets/{path}` (§A4): serves any non-`.md`, non-ignored file from the content tree.
 *
 * Security path (frozen, chunk 1.5 rules): the RAW url tail → `PercentCoding.decodeOnce` (the one
 * decoder; `%2F`, malformed escapes, invalid UTF-8 all rejected) → `TreePath` (NFC; traversal and
 * absoluteness structurally impossible) → snapshot membership (`PageIndex.assets`, which excludes
 * `.md` pages and everything the scan ignored) → the membership-gated `ContentStore.read` (raw-name
 * read-back + NOFOLLOW containment). There is no direct filesystem access here.
 *
 * A miss against the content tree falls back to the embedded SPA bundle under `static/assets/`
 * (the Vite build emits its js/css there): the content tree wins any name it actually uses, and
 * the [TreePath] validation above already guarantees the resource lookup cannot escape `static/`.
 *
 * **Deliberate asymmetry with the page endpoints:** pages serve ENTIRELY from the published index
 * snapshot (coherent markdown/html/hash, see `PageService`), but assets stay LIVE disk reads —
 * disk is the source of truth for binaries, and a just-deleted asset answering 404 is correct,
 * not a torn read. There is nothing per-asset to keep coherent with the snapshot.
 *
 * **Serving safety (W3b — two orthogonal layers):**
 *  - **MIME-sniff XSS — handled here now.** W3b's upload route lets any writer plant a file whose
 *    bytes don't match its extension (e.g. HTML named `logo.png`, served `image/png`). Every asset
 *    response carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` so a sniffing browser can't reinterpret it as
 *    HTML. A pure win — no UX cost, no dependency, trust-model-independent — so it lands now.
 *  - **Scriptable SVG/HTML on direct navigation — STAYS the auth-phase deferral.** An uploaded
 *    `diagram.svg` is served `image/svg+xml` and is scriptable when navigated to directly. The real
 *    mitigations (`Content-Disposition: attachment` to force-download, or `Content-Security-Policy:
 *    sandbox`) carry a UX / trust-model dimension — forcing attachment breaks legitimate inline
 *    `<img src=…foo.svg>` — so the CSP/sandbox decision belongs to the auth phase, alongside the rest
 *    of the trust model. `nosniff` is the orthogonal first layer, not a substitute for it.
 *
 * A3 (§WI-5, the SPLIT): the read GATE fires on the content-tree branch BEFORE the membership test, so an
 * anonymous request to a content asset gets 401/403 — never a 404 that distinguishes "exists but unauth" from
 * "absent" (no existence leak). The order is: decode → `read.assetRead` (which checkRead-gates, throws→401/403,
 * THEN tests content-tree membership). The outcome is a 3-way [com.plainbase.domain.service.AssetReadOutcome]:
 *  - `NotContentAsset` — not in the content tree → fall through to the PUBLIC bundled-static fallback (the SPA's
 *    own js/css), then 404 if that misses too.
 *  - `Found` — an indexed asset's current on-disk bytes → serve.
 *  - `IndexedButMissing` — an indexed asset whose file vanished → **404**, NEVER the bundled fallback. Conflating
 *    this with `NotContentAsset` would let a vanished upload unmask a bundled-static name it shadowed (e.g. an
 *    uploaded `favicon.ico` deleted on disk would serve the BUNDLED one — disk is source of truth, so it's a 404).
